This starter kit provides two alternate HTML files: `index.html` loads the Touch JS/CSS libraries from [Sencha's content delivery network][cdn] (CDN); `local.html` loads the libraries locally. Using Sencha's CDN is most convenient, because it does not require you to download the Sencha Touch SDK, but it does require an internet connection. If you are working offline, then you will have to [install the Sencha Touch libraries][installation].
